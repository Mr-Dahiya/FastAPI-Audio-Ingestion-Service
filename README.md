# FastAPI-Audio-Ingestion-Service
This project implements a resilient, high-performance microservice designed to ingest real-time audio metadata from a PBX (Private Branch Exchange) system. It features non-blocking ingestion, strict state machine transitions, and a background processing layer that handles "unreliable" external AI dependencies with robust error handling.
